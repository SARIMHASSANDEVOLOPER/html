  <p>Dear Rizwan Bhatti</p>
  <p>My name is Sarim Hassan Hashmi. I am 11 years old and I study in 4th class. I am a student at SMIT where I am learning HTML and CSS. I am very excited to learn web development because I want to make websites in the future.</p>

  <p>I am hardworking and love learning new things about computers and technology. My teachers say that I am a good student and I always try to do my best in class.</p>

  <p>I want to become a web developer when I grow up. Thatâ€™s why I am learning HTML and CSS at SMIT. I enjoy making web pages and designing them with colors and styles. This is my first step toward my dream.</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading my letter.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,
    <br>
    Sarim Hassan Hashmi
